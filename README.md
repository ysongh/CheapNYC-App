# CheapNYC-App
A platform that helps people find accessible prices such as foods, events, and classes in NYC.

### Note
- run "react-native link react-native-image-picker" to make the image picker work
- run "react-native link" to link the react-native-fetch-blob
- run "react-native link react-native-maps" to use Apple Maps

### What I Learned?

- use Marker component API to add a pin on the map

### What I Did?
