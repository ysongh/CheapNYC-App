Using React Native

### Note
- run "react-native link react-native-image-picker" to make the image picker work
- run "react-native link" to link the react-native-fetch-blob

### What I Learned?
- setState is asynchronous
- use react-native-image-picker to upload an image
- use Picker for select element
- multiline and numberOfLines allow text input to have multiple lines

### What I Did?

- Display user favorites deals and deals they made on user profile
- Add checkbox
- Allow user to change their name, interests, and image
- Add deal form
